# Fuel Log API

## Problem

With fuel prices rising steadily over the last 5 years, more car owners are looking for ways to keep running costs down. This application will provide a way for users to track their fuel consuption from bowser to bowser, while providing a forecast based on their fuel consumption and current fuel costs at the bowsers which will be useful for bugeting purposes. As well as bowser to bowser tracking, the app will provide users the option to track fuel comsuption for specific trips of their choosing. The second option provides better estimations for the costs and comsuption averages.

The app will help the user with budgeting for the month or even for the week. This will be done by tracking the fuel expenses every week for each month. The user will then be provided with data estimating the next month's fuel expenses which will allow the user to include that in their monthly budget. This reporting feature will provide the total fuel cost, the average fuel price, and total distance for the month and allow the user to compare fuel expenses for each month.

With the feature invovling trips, the user will be able to plan and budget for trips based on their recent consumption history and the current fuel prices.
